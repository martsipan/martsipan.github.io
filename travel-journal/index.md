## Travel Journal

I wanted to cancel my social media accounts since a long time, for many reasons, but most importantly when it comes to my work and my artistic practice. So I decided to take care and charge of my own archive and history writing, as far as thats possible. Because archiving is very important and should not be left in the hands of global corporations! (◔◡◔✿)

In this diary I will share my current activities and work process, as well as glancing into the future. This will be followed by a recap from earlier pieces and projects. In this way I can stay connected to my previous work, and take the opportunity to reflect on past events, something that I otherwise rarely do. So thats a good combo I think! Happy reading!

*THEN*
A year has passed since I wrote last time. Here's a short recap of what has happened since then:

1. New Love Music
I released a cassette on [Warm Winters Ltd.](https://warmwinters.ltd/) Its a piece called *New Love Music* that I composed for a performance at 3hd Festival in Berlin in 2017. Ive always wanted to release this music, and Im grateful that it landed on Adam Badí Donoval's Warm Winters. Its been super much fun working together, Im very proud and excited that this music is out. You will find a link to it under RELEASES.
2. Filled with Happy Drones
Ive played together with cellist and composer [Stellan Veloce](http://stellanveloce.de/about/) last year. With support from [inm](https://www.inm-berlin.de/en/) we created *Filled with Happy Drones*, a piece for cello, violin, synthesizer, electronics and LED lights that was performed at ACUD in Berlin in August. You can watch the whole concert under MUSIC!
3. A Sensoral Lecture
After working together for a more then a year, [Sindri Runudde's](https://vimeo.com/user17315986) solo piece *A Sensoral Lecture* was finally premiered at Atalante in Göteborg in October. Working with Sindri was wonderful in so many ways! <3 You can watch the whole show on Vimeo, click here --> [( ˘ ³˘)♥](https://vimeo.com/467869910)

*NOW*
What comes in 2021:
1. Tiny Chronicler
Later this year we will finally introduce *Tiny Chronicler* to the world! It will be an instrument and an additional band member to [Passepartout Duo](https://passepartoutduo.com/). Me and [Andreas Dzialocha](https://adz.garden/) are explaining everything in this little trailer -->   [ ⍤⃝](https://fb.watch/36K22XMhM2/)
2. Wytomyśl
As part of the project [Girls Play in Pairs](https://girlsplayinpairs.com/) Im working with an archive of recordings of my grandfather telling stories from his life. My hope is that this material will transform into a sound installation and be presented in Wytomyśl, the village where my grandfather was born. It will take place in the fruit garden that belongs to the house that my great great grandfather Roman Sokołowski built in 1894. 
3. Upcoming releases
Ive just released *Pieces from Anne's Lullaby* on the Italian label [SUPERPANG](https://superpang.bandcamp.com/). In March comes my first LP *TKAĆ* on Swedish [Thantosis](https://thanatosis.org/). Very exciting! I love releasing music! <3

*NOW*

✧･ﾟHappy New Year! (ꈍ ꒳ ꈍ✿)*:･ﾟ✧*

So the year starts with siting opening a new calendar, understanding and visualising all the things that are coming up now, and place them in boxes and dates. Organise so that everything has its place and time, and make sure there is a lot of air in-between, haha! ▼·ᴥ·▼

I want to tell you have super mega proud I am to be mentioned in the [Nida Art Colony Log No. 9 On Lines & Rituals](http://nidacolony.lt/en/colony-log). I spent March-April 2018 at [Nida Art Colony](http://nidacolony.lt/) in Lithuania. During my first month I created an installation in which I presented a performance lecture, something I never ever done before! This was such a special projects, and such a special time - to spend two whole months in Nida, watching this silent place turn from winter to spring. This is the text from the Log: *The Hexagon: Marta was mainly interested in the work of the other artists at the Nida Colony. Through sharing work processes, discussing art and politics and hanging out as friends, a collage-like installation began to take shape. Consisting of text, fabrics, LED-light strips, wooden sculptures, music, video and pictures, it told stories from her time in Nida, as well as historical depictions of female light house keepers, space research and conspiracy theories. In a form of a "lecture performance", using music and storytelling, she explained her work process, raising questions concerning togetherness, sisterhood, feminism, and the power of shaping the future by imagining new realities and utopias.*

*THEN*
Todays ”NOW” actually already touches on ”THEN”, but sometimes these things behaves like that. I want to share some Nida pictures with you, since there is no other traces of this piece anywhere else. And a picture of the dunes, of course!

## October 31st 2019

*NOW*
Berlin is cold, but not yet frosty, and tomorrow November starts. Im once again siting in my office, and its been my first week of working since I came home from Bassano del Grappa in Italy where I did a residency together with the two dancers [Sindri Runudde](https://vimeo.com/user17315986) and [Empo Enlund](https://www.empoenlund.com/). We are working on a solo performance for Sindri, that will be premiered at Skånes Dansteater in May next year. The piece is called “Paradise Bois – A Sensorial Lecture”, and it's based on a movement practice created by Sindri called Centered Adventures: *The audience is invited into a metaphorical landscape where improvisation methods based on touch and listening are combined with romantic dating scenarios. The piece is exploring touch and listening from a disabled body perspective, which Sindri researches through bringing up perspectives on sensorial hierarchies.*

We spent two weeks of exciting studio work, gnocchis, Aperol Spritz, Italian mountains and bois, cappuccios, sonic intimacy and intensity, pizza, pasta and a lot of, lot of laughter. (*´∀｀*) 

*THEN*
So I would like to tell you about an on going collaboration Im doing together with sleep and dream artist [Anne Glassner](https://www.anneglassner.at/). We met the first time at a residency at wonderful [Nida Art Colony](http://nidacolony.lt/) in March 2018. Since then Ive joined Annes collective naps, which is basically an afternoon nap together with a group of people in public space. Ive been playing music, or singing, to the nap, and last time I made a 90 minutes long piece based on a lullaby that was playing for a small figure of Anne sleeping. It was presented at [Whitedwarf Projects](https://www.facebook.com/whitedwarfprojects/) in Vienna this summer. For the future we are planning a series of sleep ins: *In our interventions and evenings we create a dreamy atmosphere, more a personal lullaby – which is simple, repetitive and peaceful. This lullaby could take us on a deep sleep while touching our subconsciousness, maybe we could wake up in another moment when the global relationship with nature might be different. We would like to explore its poetic power and use rituals for a deep sleep. We embrace place via transdisciplinary approaches and experiments that lead to creation. The evenings are process based – some might only take as long as a nap others might be over night. Some evenings will include dreamy dinners and communicative breakfasts.*

# July 15th 2019

*NOW*
Im siting in my studio office in Berlin. Im sharing a very beautiful room with my friend [Kaj](https://www.kajduncandavid.com/) and my partner [Andreas](https://andreasdzialocha.com/). Its extremely cosy! Looking through the window I see the [Chinese wisteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisteria_sinensis) (Blåregn på svenska), all green and fluffy. There are still some flowers left, but the blooming is over since some time. 

At the moment Im preparing my recording device for this weekends interviews in Copenhagen. Me and my friend and colleague Anna Jakobsson are meeting six composers and sound artists from south of Sweden and Denmark to talk about what is inspiring and moving them in their artistic practice. We will record all these meetings and this will then become a part of a sound installation that [Konstmusiksystrar](http://konstmusiksystrar.se/) will present at [VBKÖ](https://www.vbkoe.org/) - Vereinigung Bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs (Austrian Association of Women Artists) in Vienna later this year.

*THEN*
In January 2019 the piece [Gentle Acts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dFlrUdx9xA) was premiered by [Passepartout Duo](https://passepartoutduo.com/) in Italy. Since then they have performed it so so so so many times and all around the world, I cant believe how great they are and what a strange and incredible feeling it is to have a piece of music traveling around, without me! Its like flying or teleportation, or as if Im expanding. The piece is based on a poem by the Swedish poet, artist and writer [Channa Riedel](https://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/jag-ber-med-mina-f%C3%B6tter-1.14832172) with whom I was collaborating with for this piece. Channa is so cool, colourful, brave and sharp, and her poem had great influence on the music. The title of this piece is very much inspired by writings of feminist scholar [Donna Haraway](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/75/67125/tentacular-thinking-anthropocene-capitalocene-chthulucene/). 
Here is a [radio show](http://1trackpodcast.com/1-track-contemporary-classical-podcast-passepartout-duo-s7e10/) where Passepartout Duo are talking about this piece. 
In general Im so grateful for the possibility of working together with so good people and artists, Gentle Acts is a piece and experience that still warms my heart! <3 <3 <3
