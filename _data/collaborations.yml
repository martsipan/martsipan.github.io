- title: Collective Naps
  description: In 2018 I met Alicja Bilewska, Lynette Smith, Veronika Burger, Anne Glassner and Katherine Behar during a residency at Nida Art Colony in Lithuania. Since then we keep meeting for collective naps online, sleeping together in three different time zones. We also keep participating in eachothers projects, like "How do we go on?" from 2020 by Lynette.

- title: Sleep Laboratory (ongoing)
  description: In the sleep laboratory five artists from different fields (visual arts, music and light, dance and body practices) deal with different aspects of sleep like the state between waking and sleeping, dreaming, caring, the bed and other spatial aspects of good sleep. They address and investigate possibilities and the potential of sleep as a communal and regenerative experience in times where the society we live in appears to be exhausted, and in need of space to dream. The receptive sleeping body as well as living in the paradox of dream images decelerates our collective loneliness and opens a sensual, intimate space. Together with Anita Kaya, Agnes Schneidewind, Anne Glassner and Johanna Nielson.
