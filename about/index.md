Marta Forsberg is a Swedish-Polish sound artist and musician based in Berlin. In recent years, she has released music through labels such as Warm Winters Ltd., XKatedral, and Superpang. Her work delves into themes of language and human memory, with a strong focus on archival research. 

Lately, she has been experimenting with the interplay between human and synthetic voices, creating soundscapes that are both intimate and ethereal. Marta frequently collaborates with performers and choreographers like Sindri Runudde and Sheena McGrandles, while also engaging in pedagogical work, teaching music composition. 

Alongside [Lo Kristenson](https://lokristenson.com/), she co-founded [Konstmusiksystrar](http://konstmusiksystrar.se/), an organization dedicated to promoting gender equality in the Swedish music scene. Marta studied electroacoustic composition at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw.
