- title: Sleep Laboratory (ongoing)
  description: In the sleep laboratory five artists from different fields (visual arts, music and light, dance and body practices) deal with different aspects of sleep like the state between waking and sleeping, dreaming, caring, the bed and other spatial aspects of good sleep. They address and investigate possibilities and the potential of sleep as a communal and regenerative experience in times where the society we live in appears to be exhausted, and in need of space to dream. The receptive sleeping body as well as living in the paradox of dream images decelerates our collective loneliness and opens a sensual, intimate space. Terms like privacy and publicity are being questioned.
